# Welcome to Maryam

### Current Version: 0.0

Maryam (named after Maryam Mirzakhani, Professor of Mathematics at the University of Stanford and the first ever female recipient of the Fields Medal) is a scientific graphing calculator made in Python. We've based Maryam off of the Numworks calculator, so the layout and features are going to be similar. Please do note that the Python function that exists in the Numworks calculator does not work here.

# Modes

### Calculation
This mode simply calculates mathematical scripts. I mean, what more can we say?

### Graph
This mdoe graphs functions. Note that in this version Maryam can graph one function at a time. Multi-function graphing is a feature that we hope to add in later versions of Maryam.

### Solver
This modes solves equations. Note that unlike Numowrks which this calculator is based on, we don't offer templates for equations. You'll have to write everything yourself.

# How to use

### Installation
Installation is simple. You can download the source files for the program, located in the "maryam" directory and store them in a directory of your choosing. You can also clone the entire repository to your system if you prefer.

*NOTE: ALL FILES SHOULD BE STORED IN THE SAME DIRECTORY FOR THE PROGRAM TO WORK*

### Executing the program
Open the terminal/command line and navigate to the folder where the file is located. run the command:

    python3 main.py

The program should initialize. Alternatively, you can use the GUI to navigate to the folder in which you are storing the program and opening the script in a python compiler/interpreter of your choosing.  

*NOTE: Your computer has to have Python 3 installed for this program to work. To install Python 3, go to [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python Official Download")*

### Navigating menus
Navigate menus by typing the number on the side of each menu item and then pressing enter. In any menu, or even during calculations, you can type in "home" and press enter to return to the main menu

### Terminating the program
This program will not terminate unless you tell it to. In order to terminate the program, simply type "quit" into any input line throughout the program (no matter if it's a math input or a menu) and the program will terminate. Of course, you can use the keyboard interrupt as well if you want.

Hey there. I'm a high schooler that likes to code. I made Maryam as a fun project to improve my Python skills
